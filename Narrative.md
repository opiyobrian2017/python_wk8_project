### Key Insights:
1. COVID-19 Trends Across Selected Countries
   - The line charts for total cases and deaths over time reveal that the USA experienced the highest number of cases and deaths among the selected countries (Kenya, USA, India).
   - India showed a steep rise in cases during specific periods, likely corresponding to major pandemic waves.

2. Daily New Cases
   - The daily new cases chart highlights significant spikes in India and the USA, indicating periods of rapid virus spread. Kenya, on the other hand, maintained relatively lower daily new cases.

3. Vaccination Progress
   - If vaccination data is included, the USA likely had the fastest vaccine rollout among the selected countries, with a higher percentage of its population vaccinated compared to Kenya and India.

4. Correlation Between Metrics
   - The heatmap shows a strong positive correlation between `total_cases` and `total_deaths`, as expected. However, the correlation between `new_cases` and `death_rate` might reveal interesting patterns, such as how healthcare systems managed new cases.

5. Top Countries by Total Cases
   - The bar chart for total cases by country highlights the USA as a leader in total cases, followed by India. Kenya's total cases are significantly lower, reflecting either lower spread or underreporting.

### Anomalies or Interesting Patterns:
- Death Rate Variations:
  - The calculated `death_rate` might show significant differences between countries, reflecting disparities in healthcare infrastructure and pandemic response.
- Vaccination Gaps:
  - If vaccination data is visualized, the pie charts may reveal stark contrasts in vaccinated vs. unvaccinated populations, especially in Kenya compared to the USA.

### Deliverables:
These insights can be presented in a report or dashboard, supported by the visualizations (line charts, bar charts, heatmaps, and optional choropleth maps). Let me know if you need help formatting the narrative or creating a detailed report!
